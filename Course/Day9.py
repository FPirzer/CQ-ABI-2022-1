# In our second lesson on this day we talked about NumPy or numerical python.
# This module allows the user to use many different mathematical operations for
# working with arrays and matrices. At the center of this module is the numpy
# ndarray that can be created in several different ways. To work with NumPy
# you should use an import as shown below, since it follows international
# conventions for using an alias
import numpy as np

# After we imported NumPy we can generate our Arrays. The first method is to
# cast a list to an arrayy with the np.array() method
Array1 = np.array([5, 6, 8, 1, 5])
# The second and third option is to create arrays that contain only 0 (zeros)
# or only 1 (ones). Any ohter methods aren't supported. We can hand over
# multiple dimensions to these two methods and we have to use the same number of
# brackets as the matrix dimensions should be. The order of these dimensions is
# from the back to the front: columns, rows, matrices
Array2 = np.ones(5)
Array3 = np.zeros((3, 6))
Array4 = np.ones(((5, 6, 7)))
# We can now print our four arrays
print("Our Arrays look like this:")

# Numpy also has a function np.arange() that creates an array in a similar
# fashion to the already known range() generator

# that the dimensions you hand over to reshape have to match the number of
# entries in your Array

# Last but not least we can generate random entries for our arrays. The values
# are from a "standard normal" distribution
Array6 = np.random.randn(4, 6)
print(Array6)
print("")
# NumPy furthermore gives access to manx simple functions that can be used on
# its arrays. The most notable are sum(), max() and min() that calculate the
# sum, maximum value and minimum value of your array. In stark contrast to the
# normal sum, max and min methods these work on multi-dimensional arrays as
# good as on one-dimensional ones, wereas the standard methods only work on
# one-dimensional ones.

# We can use the shape method to get the shape method to look up the dimensions
# of our arrays
print("Dimensions of Array1:", Array1.shape)

# A last function I want to present ot you is the transpose() method, that
# switches lines and columns in your Arrays.

print("The transposed Array6 looks like this:")
print(Array7)
# You can access specific values of your arrays with the help of indices just
# like you could with lists. The order is again from the back to the front:
# columns, rows, matrices ...
# Keep in mind that the indexing in python starts at 0
print("Value in row 2 and column 5 of Array6:", Array6[1][4])

# In the afternoon we started working with pandas. To use pandas we need to
# import the module again. Similar to numpy there is an international standard
# for importing pandas with an alias called pd
import pandas as pd

# In the center of pandas stands its data structure called DataFrame which can
# be generated as seen below. The DataFrame shown here can also be used for
# exercise 39

# To access specific values in a DataFrame you can use either loc or iloc. The
# loc mehtod allows you to access your values with the help of your index and
# column names. The index or row name comes always first and than comes your
# column name
print("The entry in row Test1 at column C is:", dataframe1.loc["Test1", "C"])
# If you use iloc you have to use two separate square brackets. You can use
# this method to access your values via Index and columns numbers. Again the
# row comes first and than the column. Remember that indexing starts at 0. If
# you use integer values as index or column names pandas can be confused, so
# use strings only
print("The entry in row 0 at column 1 is:", dataframe1.iloc[0][1])
print("")
# You can add new rows (or columns) to your dataframe, by simply assigning
# values to entries that aren't part of the DataFrame yet. In the example
# below we add a fifth row called "Test5" and put the value of 2.46 in column
# "B" of this row. All other entries of the newly added row are empty
dataframe1.loc["Test5", "B"] = 2.46
print("Our DataFrame after adding a row looks like this")
print(dataframe1)
print("")
# Pandas offers a variety of different functions to work with its DataFrames.
# We will talk only about sum, index, columns and sort_values here.
# First we have df.sum(), which calculates the sum of each columns of the
# DataFrame it's used on
print("The Sums of the Columns are:\n", dataframe1.sum())
print("")
# By handing over the parameter axis=1 we can change the behavior of sum, so
# that now the sum is calculated over the rows instead of the columns. This is
# true for many pandas methods. The default behavior is always to work on
# columns instead of rows.
print("The Sums of the Rows are:\n", dataframe1.sum(axis=1))
print("")
# You can use the methods df.index and df.columns to generate iterable objects
# that contain the index and column names respectively. So that you could use
# them in a loop for example to iterate over all your columns
print("Our indices look like this:", dataframe1.index)
print("Our column names look like this:", dataframe1.columns)
print("")
# You can also sort your DataFrame with the df.sort_values() method. You have
# to hand over the name of the column for which you wnat to sort your values.
# These operations can be done in place so if you don't want to change your
# DataFrame hand over the sorted DataFrame to a new object as shown below.
dataframe2 = dataframe1.sort_values("A")
print("Our DataFrame sorted according to column A looks like this:")

# Last but not least you have a describe function that calculates means,
# standard deviations, maxima, minima and percentiles for your columns
